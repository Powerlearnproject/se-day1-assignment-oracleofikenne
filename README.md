Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software systems.
 It is used to create software products that solve real-world problems. Â 
 for the creation of software applications uised in modern day world.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
It enabled the development of programming languages like Fortrand and C.
It allowed for the establishment of Software engineering as a discipline.
It allowed for the advent of structured programming inthe 1970s.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1) PLANNING;- This is the initial phase where the project's scope, goals, and feasibility are defined.
2) REQUIIREMENTS;- This involves gathering,dociumenting and arranging users`s needs and system requirements.
3) DESIGN;- This phase involves system design, database design, interface design, and component design.
4) IMPLEMENTATION;- This involves writing the code and building the software according to specific designs.
5) TESTING;- Conducting variouis test to ensuire the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
6) DEPLOYMENT;- This is the stage where the software is released into the enviroment for friendly users.
7) MAINTENANCE;- Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Feature :  	Waterfall   	Agile
Approach :	 Sequential 	Iterative
Flexibility:  Low	       High
Documentation:  Extensive	  Minimal
Cust involvement: Limited    High
Projectscope :  	Fixed	        Flexible
Risk:             High               Low

Applications of Waterfall methodology
1) Buiilding a bridge
2)  Developing a medical device

Applications os Agile Methodology
1) Building a webapp
2) Developing a new mobile app








Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
 Integrated Development Environments are Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code.. Example;= Visiiual studio Code, Eclipse.
 Version Control Systems (VCS) are Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members Examples;- Github, Subversion).


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1) Meeting deadlines: Tight project timelines can lead to stress and compromised quality.
2) Strategy: Effective time management, prioritization, and breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable units can help. Consider agile methodologies for flexibility.
3) Managing changing requirements: Client needs and market trends evolve, often necessitating changes to the project.
4) Strategy: Embrace adaptability, maintain open communication with stakeholders, and use version control to track changes effectively. Agile methodologies can help manage changing requirements iteratively.
5) Ensuring code quality and maintainability: Writing clean, efficient, and understandable code is crucial for long-term project success.






Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1) Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
 2)  Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
 3)  System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
4) Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
